# QL Pirate Islands

Written in SuperBASIC for the Sinclair QL, Pirate Islands is based on a common dice game. 
Collect as much treasure as you can without getting caught by the navy.

Up to 10 players can play, each can be either a human or computer player.
Each player takes turns to visit 3 islands, the islands can be empty, have treasure or a navy patrol.

You choose when to stop visiting the islands, try to get the most treasure without getting caught 3 times. 
If you do, they confiscate your treasure and your turn ends.

The first player to acquire 13 treasures triggers the end of the game, the remaining players get to carry on until all have had the same number of turns.

The player with the most treasure wins.
